ic-06 - Intro to JavaScript

Link to GitHub Pages: `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]`

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to start learning how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to webpages.  

## Instructions

1. Background material to support this assignment is provided below in the Resources section.  

1. Create a GitHub Page for your repo and add the link to your GitHub Page above where you see `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]`. 

1. Clone this repo and work locally. Be sure to push the final version of your code (and any significant updates along the way) before submitting. 

1. Add an **external** stylesheet to the index.html file inclided in this repo. Use the stylesheet to make all font on your webpage Arial. 

1. A JavaScript file (main.js) was included in your repo. Add this file to your index.html file as an **external** script file. All of your JavaScript programming should be contained in this file ([JavaScript Where To](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp)).  

1. Notice Button 1, and and the random_num div in your index.html file. Modify Button 1 so that "button1Clicked()" (in main.js) is called when Button 1 is clicked. Fill in the contents of button1Clicked() such that each time Button 1 is clicked a new random number is shown in the random_num div. 

1. Under Button 1 and the random_num div, add another button, Button 2, and a blue svg circle. Button 2 and the circle should be side-by-side on the webpage. Add functionality such that when Button 2 is clicked the circle changes color. If the circle is blue, clicking Button 2 should make it green. If the circle is green, clicking Button 2 should make it blue. You may use CSS or inline styling to achieve this functionality.
